# TV Script Generator

This project demonstrates the use of RNNs for script generation. It will create a new "fake" TV script based on the 9 seasons of Seinfeld TV serries. 

## Setup

Install PyTorch (I used v1.2.0 for development):
```
pip install torch
```

Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/puhach/tv-script-gen.git
```

## Acknowledgements
